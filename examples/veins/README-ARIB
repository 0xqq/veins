Veins tutorial example with ARIB STD-T109.

This simulation requires sumo-launchd to be started and listening for 
connections on a TCP socket, e.g. using "~/src/veins/sumo-launchd.py -vv".

# Implementation
The implementation of the ARIB T109 MAC layer is located in <root>/src/veins/modules/mac/aribt109.
There, all necessary files can be found.

## Architecture
The MAC layer consists of two different implementations distinguishing between RSUs (base stations) and vehicles (mobile stations).
Both share a common abstract base class which contains functionality utilized in both implementations.
The MAC layer combines the CSMA/CA functionalitiy from IEEE 802.11p MAC and the IVC-RVC layer from ARIB T109 which utilizes the TDMA scheme.

# NOTES

The current version is only compatible with OMNeT++ 5.

Run with "./run -f arib.ini".
